# Cost Usage

The `cost_explorer` task outputs data showing the usage & cost of a specified service in a given account / list of
accounts.

The service being queried needs to be specified using its full name, example:

- Amazon Api Gateway
- Amazon Cloudfront
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon Simple Storage Service
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
- AWS CodePipeline
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodeArtifact
- AWS Lambda
- AWS X-Ray

You can see a list of full names of services by clicking on the service [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html),
then you'll see the full name on the next page, i.e "**Amazon Simple Storage Service** Documentation".

## Usage

```sh
./platsec_aws_scanner.sh cost_explorer -m 07 -y 2021 -s "AWS Lambda" -u freda.bloggs -t 123456 -a 999888777666
```

### Arguments

- `-m / --month`: represents the month to start the search from. Must be in *n* or *nn* format without the leading zero
- `-y / --year`: represents the year to start the search from. Must be in *nnnn* format
- `-s / --services`: comma-separated list of service(s) to scan usage for

The scanner will check for costs and usage from the 1st day of the month and year specified
in the command, ending on the current date. However, [AWS Cost Explorer documentation][aws-cost-explorer] states that
the end
date is exclusive, meaning that AWS will check cost usage up to the date *proceeding* the requested end date.

See the [common arguments section](../usage.md#common-arguments) for details on the common arguments.
