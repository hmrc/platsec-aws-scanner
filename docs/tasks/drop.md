# Drop Athena databases and tables

The `drop` task drops Athena databases and tables that were created by previously run tasks.

**Notes**:

-   the `drop` task only drops Athena databases whose names start with the `database_prefix` as configured in
    [the configuration file](../configuration.md#athena)

-   the targeted Athena databases and tables are expected to be in the `athena` account as configured in
    [the configuration file](../configuration.md#athena)

## Usage

```sh
./platsec_aws_scanner.sh drop -u john.doo -t 123456
```
